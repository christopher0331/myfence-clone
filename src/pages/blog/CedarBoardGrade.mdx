# Choosing Cedar Fence Board Grade: A Complete Guide

When planning your cedar fence installation, one of the most important decisions you'll make is selecting the right board grade. At MyFence.com, we offer several cedar fence board options, each with distinct characteristics, benefits, and price points. This guide will help you understand the differences and choose the best option for your project.

## Understanding Cedar Board Dimensions

Before diving into grades, it's important to understand board dimensions. At MyFence.com, we primarily work with two widths:

- **1x4 boards**: Approximately 3.5 inches wide (actual dimension)
- **1x6 boards**: A true 6 inches wide

The width you choose affects both the aesthetic and structural characteristics of your fence.

## 1x6x6 #1 & Better Cedar Fence Boards

### What is #1 & Better Grade?

The #1 & Better grade represents a premium cedar option that balances quality with value. This grade allows for some natural characteristics like small knots and minor color variation, while maintaining excellent structural integrity and appearance.

### Key Features:
- **True 6-inch width** provides maximum coverage
- **Superior structural strength** due to wider board dimension
- **Tight knots** that remain secure over time
- **Natural cedar grain patterns** for authentic beauty
- **Excellent durability** for long-lasting fences

### Best For:
- Standard privacy fences
- [Picture frame style fences](/fence-styles/picture-frame-fence)
- Properties where natural wood character is desired
- Budget-conscious projects requiring quality materials

### Advantages of 6-inch Width:
The wider boards naturally provide more structural integrity and require fewer boards to complete your fence, potentially reducing labor costs. The substantial feel of 6-inch boards creates a solid, premium appearance.

## 1x4x6 #1 - 2 Face Cedar Fence Boards

### What is #1 - 2 Face Grade?

This grade designation means the boards have at least one face (side) that meets #1 grade standards, with the second face potentially having more natural characteristics. These narrower boards are specifically chosen for their application in pattern-based fence designs.

### Key Features:
- **Narrower 3.5-inch width** perfect for patterns
- **Versatile design applications**
- **Good quality** with natural cedar characteristics
- **Cost-effective** for certain fence styles

### Best For:
- [Horizontal lattice fences](/fence-styles/horizontal-lattice-fence)
- [Craftsman style fences](/fence-styles/craftsman-style-fence)
- Decorative pattern work
- Projects emphasizing design over solid privacy

### The Shrinkage Advantage:

One often-overlooked benefit of narrower boards is their dimensional stability. Here's why this matters:

- **Less material width** means less total shrinkage
- With only 4 inches to shrink versus 6 inches, the relative shrinkage is significantly less
- **Fewer gaps develop** between boards over time
- More consistent appearance throughout the fence's lifespan

This makes 1x4 boards an excellent choice for pattern-based designs where gap consistency is important.

## 1x4x6 Clear Cedar Fence Boards

### What Makes Clear Cedar Special?

Clear cedar represents the premium end of cedar grading. These boards are carefully selected to be virtually knot-free, offering the most uniform appearance and longest lifespan.

### Key Features:
- **Nearly knot-free** appearance
- **Uniform grain patterns** throughout
- **Superior longevity** - no knot holes to fall out
- **Premium aesthetic** for high-end projects
- **Better dimensional stability** over time

### Benefits of Going Clear:

**Longevity**: Without knots, there are no weak points where moisture can penetrate or pieces can fall out over time. Your fence maintains its integrity longer.

**Uniform Appearance**: Clear cedar boards age more consistently, maintaining a uniform look as they weather naturally.

**Long-term Value**: While the initial cost is higher, the extended lifespan and reduced maintenance often make clear cedar more cost-effective over the fence's lifetime.

### Ideal Applications:
- Premium [horizontal lattice installations](/fence-styles/horizontal-lattice-fence)
- High-visibility fence sections
- Properties where appearance is paramount
- Homeowners planning to stain or finish their fence

## 1x4x8 Clear Cedar Fence Boards

### Extended Length Clear Cedar

The 8-foot length option in clear cedar offers the same premium, knot-free quality with the added benefit of extended board length for taller fence installations or specific design requirements.

### Key Features:
- **8-foot length** for taller applications
- **All benefits of clear cedar** quality
- **Fewer joints** required in tall fence sections
- **Premium appearance** maintained

### Best Uses:
- Tall privacy fences (7-8 feet)
- [Lattice topper installations](/fence-upgrades/lattice-toppers)
- Decorative top sections
- Architectural detail work

### Design Flexibility:

The 8-foot length allows for creative applications like continuous lattice patterns that span greater heights without seams, or decorative top sections that maintain their clean appearance.

### Key Features:
- **True 6-inch width** for maximum coverage
- **Virtually knot-free** premium appearance
- **Superior structural integrity**
- **Longest lifespan** of all options
- **Most uniform aging** and weathering

### Premium Performance:

This combination delivers both the structural advantages of wider boards and the longevity benefits of clear cedar. These boards are our top recommendation for customers who want the absolute best in both appearance and performance.

### Perfect For:

- Properties with strict aesthetic standards
- Long-term investment fences (20+ years)
- Featured fence sections visible from the street

## Making Your Choice

### Consider These Factors:

**Budget**: Clear cedar costs more upfront but may offer better long-term value. Standard grades provide excellent quality at a lower initial cost.

**Aesthetic Goals**: If a uniform, premium appearance is crucial, clear cedar is worth the investment. If you appreciate natural wood character, #1 & Better grades are beautiful.

**Fence Style**: Pattern-based designs like [craftsman style](/fence-styles/craftsman-style-fence) and [horizontal lattice](/fence-styles/horizontal-lattice-fence) often benefit from narrower 1x4 boards.

**Longevity Plans**: Planning to stay in your home for decades? Clear cedar's extended lifespan becomes more valuable.

**Maintenance Commitment**: All cedar requires maintenance, but clear cedar maintains its appearance more consistently with less intervention.
