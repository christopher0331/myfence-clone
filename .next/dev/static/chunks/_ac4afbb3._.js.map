Say goodbye to the days of seeing through the vertical gaps between fence boards. This is ideal if you want added privacy for your backyard and is a common upgrade. Solid board on the other hand is more of a uniform appearance, tight fitting boards but may still yield vertical gaps between fence boards. This is a budget friendly option.
