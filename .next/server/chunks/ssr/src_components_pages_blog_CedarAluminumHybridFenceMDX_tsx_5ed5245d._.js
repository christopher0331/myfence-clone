Perfect for homeowners seeking modern industrial aesthetics with Pacific Northwest charm.`,s=[{question:"What is a Cedar/Steel Hybrid Fence?",answer:"A cedar/steel hybrid fence combines 26 gauge corrugated steel panels with factory-finished HDP NoFade™ paint and traditional cedar framing. The steel panels replace wood fence boards, providing zero-gap privacy that never needs staining, while the cedar frame maintains that natural Pacific Northwest aesthetic."},{question:"How much does a Cedar/Steel Hybrid Fence cost?",answer:"Cedar/Steel Hybrid Fencing starts at approximately $80 per linear foot. While more expensive than traditional cedar fencing, the long-term savings from eliminating staining costs and the superior durability make it a smart investment for property perimeters."},{question:"Why do you prefer Barrier Boss panels over other suppliers?",answer:"We prefer Barrier Boss panels because they come in taller sheets. When panels are cut down to follow grade on sloped terrain, you still retain a full 6-foot fence height. With shorter panels from other suppliers, grade-following can significantly reduce your effective fence height."},{question:"What is the Ultimate Fence Package?",answer:"The Ultimate Fence Package combines 4x4x12-foot Black Steel Posts, a 6-foot cedar-framed corrugated steel panel fence, and a 2-foot cedar horizontal lattice topper. This configuration provides maximum privacy, exceptional durability, and a premium architectural appearance with a 30-year lifetime warranty option."},{question:"Can I get a lifetime warranty on a hybrid fence?",answer:"Yes! When you upgrade to 4x4 black steel fence posts, you qualify for a 30-year lifetime warranty on the system. The 26 gauge corrugated steel panels with HDP NoFade™ paint are incredibly durable, and combined with steel posts, this fence system will outlast traditional cedar by decades."},{question:"What colors are available for the steel panels?",answer:"The corrugated steel panels come in a variety of HDP NoFade™ paint colors from manufacturers like ColorMax and Barrier Boss, which we source through local distributors. Black is the most popular choice as it creates a striking contrast with natural cedar framing, but other colors are available upon request."},{question:"Do I need to maintain a Cedar/Steel Hybrid Fence?",answer:"The steel panels require zero maintenance - no staining, sealing, or treating ever. The cedar framing can optionally be stained for a uniform look, but the heavy lifting of privacy and durability is handled entirely by the maintenance-free steel panels."},{question:"Is this fence style good for sloped terrain?",answer:"Yes, particularly with Barrier Boss panels. Since they come in taller sheets, when we cut them to follow your property grade, you still maintain a full 6-foot fence height. Traditional cedar fencing and shorter panels often lose significant height on slopes."}],t={"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage",mainEntity:s.map(a=>({"@type":"Question",name:a.question,acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:a.answer}}))};return(0,b.jsxs)(b.Fragment,{children:[(0,b.jsx)(p.default,{title:"Cedar/Steel Hybrid Fence Guide | Modern Privacy Fencing",description:"Complete guide to cedar/steel hybrid fencing.
