Located 12 miles south of Seattle, Tukwila encompasses just 9.6 square miles but generates more retail sales than any other city in Washington State, thanks to Westfield Southcenter—the largest shopping mall in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nThe Duwamish people inhabited this river valley for thousands of years before European American settlers arrived in the 1850s. The name \"Tukwila\" derives from the Duwamish word for hazelnut, reflecting the native vegetation that once dominated the landscape. Early settlers established farms along the fertile river bottomlands, but the city's destiny changed dramatically with the arrival of the railroad and later, Interstate 5 and Interstate 405, which intersect within city limits.\n\nThe city's geography is defined by its river valleys and the transportation corridors that follow them. The Green River curves through the southern portion, while the Duwamish River (which the Green becomes) flows north toward Elliott Bay. This low-lying terrain historically flooded regularly until the Howard Hanson Dam brought control in 1962. Today, the valley floor hosts warehouses, retail centers, and light industrial facilities, while residential neighborhoods climb the surrounding hillsides.\n\nTukwila's climate mirrors the greater Puget Sound region with annual rainfall around 37 inches concentrated between October and May. The river valley location creates slightly higher humidity than surrounding hillside areas, and fog can settle in the lowlands during fall and winter mornings. Summers bring reliably pleasant conditions with temperatures reaching the mid-70s. The relatively flat commercial areas contrast with hillside neighborhoods that can experience different microclimates.\n\nThe economic landscape makes Tukwila unique in the region. Westfield Southcenter anchors a retail corridor that attracts shoppers from throughout the Pacific Northwest. The city's tax base means municipal services remain robust despite a modest residential population. Boeing maintains significant facilities nearby, and the commercial/industrial zones provide employment for far more people than actually live within city limits. This creates an interesting dynamic where the daytime population vastly exceeds residents.\n\nResidential Tukwila spreads across several distinct areas. The Riverton Heights and Cascade View neighborhoods occupy hillsides with views toward Mount Rainier and the Cascades. McMicken Heights near the airport handles more jet noise but offers lower housing costs. Foster, near the light rail station, is experiencing redevelopment pressure. Thorndyke and Allentown provide more established suburban character. This variety means fence installations must account for everything from busy commercial-adjacent lots to quiet hillside properties.\n\nThe city's diversity reflects its accessibility and affordability. Tukwila has become one of the most ethnically diverse cities in Washington, with large Somali, Vietnamese, and Hispanic communities reshaping the cultural landscape. Multiple languages fill the hallways of Tukwila schools, and restaurants along International Boulevard serve cuisine from around the world. This diversity extends to housing stock, from modest mid-century homes to newer apartment complexes near transit stations.`;\n\nconst TukwilaArticle = () => (\n  <article className=\"space-y-12\">\n    {/* Company Introduction */}\n    <section className=\"space-y-6\">\n      <h2 className=\"text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold\">\n        Tukwila Fence Company - MyFence.com\n      </h2>\n      <div className=\"grid md:grid-cols-4 gap-6\">\n        <Card className=\"p-6 text-center\">\n          <div className=\"text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-2\">30+</div>\n          <div className=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">Years Experience</div>\n        </Card>\n        <Card className=\"p-6 text-center\">\n          <div className=\"text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-2\">98%+</div>\n          <div className=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">On-Time Installation Rate</div>\n        </Card>\n        <Card className=\"p-6 text-center\">\n          <div className=\"text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-2\">5.0</div>\n          <div className=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">Average Star Rating</div>\n        </Card>\n        <Card className=\"p-6 text-center\">\n          <div className=\"text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-2\">150+</div>\n          <div className=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">Five-Star Reviews</div>\n        </Card>\n      </div>\n      <p className=\"text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed text-lg\">\n        Looking for reliable fence installation in Tukwila?
