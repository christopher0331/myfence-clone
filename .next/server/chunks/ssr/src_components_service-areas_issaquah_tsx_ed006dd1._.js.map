Located 17 miles east of Seattle at the convergence of three mountains—Tiger, Squak, and Cougar—Issaquah has evolved from a coal mining and hop farming community into one of the Puget Sound's most desirable addresses for families and outdoor enthusiasts.\n\nThe Snoqualmie people inhabited this valley for thousands of years before European American settlers arrived in the 1860s, drawn by timber and fertile farmland. The name \"Issaquah\" derives from a Salish word meaning \"the sound of birds\" or \"snake,\" depending on linguistic interpretation. Coal mining dominated the late 19th century economy, with several mines operating in the surrounding hills until the 1930s. The community later became famous for its salmon hatchery, established in 1936, which still releases hundreds of thousands of salmon annually and hosts the beloved Salmon Days festival each October.\n\nThe transformation from rural community to upscale suburb accelerated with Interstate 90's completion in the 1960s, putting Seattle within easy commuting distance. Costco's headquarters arrived in 1987, followed by waves of technology company employees seeking mountain-adjacent living. Today, Issaquah hosts T-Mobile's headquarters and draws residents from Microsoft, Amazon, and countless startups who want forest trails outside their back doors.\n\nIssaquah's geography defines daily life. The city occupies a valley floor surrounded by the Issaquah Alps—a local term for Tiger Mountain (3,004 feet), Squak Mountain (1,975 feet), and Cougar Mountain (1,595 feet). These peaks create a dramatic backdrop visible from most neighborhoods and offer hundreds of miles of hiking trails. Issaquah Creek flows through town, feeding into Lake Sammamish to the north. The terrain ranges from flat valley bottom near historic downtown to steep hillsides in communities like Talus and the Issaquah Highlands.\n\nThe climate reflects Issaquah's position at the Cascade foothills' edge. The city receives approximately 45 inches of annual rainfall—20-30% more than Seattle—as moisture-laden Pacific air rises against the mountains. Higher elevation neighborhoods experience occasional snow that may linger while valley floors remain clear. Summers are gloriously dry and warm, with temperatures averaging 75-80°F from July through September. Winters hover around 40°F at lower elevations but can be significantly colder on hillsides.\n\nNeighborhoods span from established communities to master-planned developments. Historic downtown maintains small-town charm with Front Street shops and restaurants. Gilman Village offers upscale shopping in converted farm buildings. The Issaquah Highlands, a massive planned community begun in the 1990s, features strict design guidelines and extensive green space. Talus rises dramatically up hillsides with contemporary architecture. Squak Mountain and Lake Sammamish neighborhoods offer larger lots and forest privacy.\n\nWildlife encounters are part of Issaquah life. Black bears roam through neighborhoods seasonally, coyotes hunt in greenbelts, and deer browse through virtually every yard without adequate fencing. Cougars occasionally make headlines, and salmon return annually to Issaquah Creek where residents gather to watch their journey. This coexistence with nature shapes everything from garbage storage to garden planning—and makes thoughtful fence design essential for protecting property while respecting the wildlife corridors that make Issaquah special.`;\nconst IssaquahArticle = () => (\n  <article className=\"space-y-12\">\n    {/* Company Introduction */}\n    <section className=\"space-y-6\">\n      <h2 className=\"text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold\">\n        Issaquah Fence Company - MyFence.com\n      </h2>\n      <div className=\"grid md:grid-cols-4 gap-6\">\n        <Card className=\"p-6 text-center\">\n          <div className=\"text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-2\">30+</div>\n          <div className=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">Years Experience</div>\n        </Card>\n        <Card className=\"p-6 text-center\">\n          <div className=\"text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-2\">98%+</div>\n          <div className=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">On-Time Installation Rate</div>\n        </Card>\n        <Card className=\"p-6 text-center\">\n          <div className=\"text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-2\">5.0</div>\n          <div className=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">Average Star Rating</div>\n        </Card>\n        <Card className=\"p-6 text-center\">\n          <div className=\"text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-2\">150+</div>\n          <div className=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">Five-Star Reviews</div>\n        </Card>\n      </div>\n      <p className=\"text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed text-lg\">\n        Looking for a trusted Issaquah fencing company?

Our Issaquah cedar installations feature Western Red Cedar sourced specifically for its natural resistance to the Cascade foothills' wet winters and temperature swings. Neighborhoods like Talus and Montreux at higher elevations benefit from our clear-grade cedar option - knot-free boards that maintain structural integrity through freeze-thaw cycles and heavy snowfall common above 500 feet.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed\">\n          Issaquah's proximity to Tiger and Cougar Mountains creates unique moisture challenges - fog, persistent drizzle, and forest canopy shade that keeps wood damp longer. We address this with extra-thick pressure-treated posts, corrosion-resistant hardware rated for mountain conditions, and construction techniques developed over three decades of Issaquah Alps installations. Our <Link href=\"/fence-upgrades/post-on-pipe\" className=\"text-primary underline decoration-2 underline-offset-2\">Post-on-Pipe system</Link> is especially valuable here, lifting cedar away from perpetually damp forest soil.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n\n      {/* Materials We Install */}\n      <div className=\"space-y-3\">\n        <h3 className=\"text-2xl font-semibold\">Fence Systems for Mountain Living</h3>\n        <p className=\"text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed\">\n          After decades installing fences throughout the Issaquah Alps, we've narrowed our focus to three systems that perform reliably at elevation: Western Red Cedar, Hogwire, and our Hybrid Aluminum/Cedar design. Rather than offering everything, we've mastered what works in Issaquah's demanding terrain - steep grades, dense tree cover, and wildlife pressure that lowland contractors rarely encounter.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed\">\n          <strong>Cedar</strong> blends naturally with forested lots in Grand Ridge and Squak Mountain neighborhoods. <strong>Hogwire panels</strong> let you maintain views of the surrounding wilderness while keeping deer out of gardens - a practical choice for properties bordering open space.

For foothills properties, we recommend 8-foot heights with reinforced posts to handle wind loads from Tiger Mountain. Hogwire fencing provides excellent wildlife visibility while maintaining security.
