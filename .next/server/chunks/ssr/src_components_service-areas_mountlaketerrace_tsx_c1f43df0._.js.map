Situated 15 miles north of Seattle, Mountlake Terrace offers affordability and livability that nearby cities have priced out of reach for many families.\n\nThe city's origins trace to the 1950s when developers transformed farmland into what they marketed as a complete planned community—among the first such developments in the Pacific Northwest. The name combines \"Mount\" (acknowledging distant views of Mount Rainier and the Cascades), \"Lake\" (referencing Lake Ballinger at its heart), and \"Terrace\" (describing the gently terraced topography). Unlike organic cities that grew over centuries, Mountlake Terrace was designed from scratch with curving streets, neighborhood parks, and a town center concept ahead of its time.\n\nLake Ballinger defines the city's geography and character. This 100-acre natural lake sits at the junction of Mountlake Terrace, Edmonds, and Shoreline, with most of its shoreline within city limits. The lake feeds Ballinger Creek, which flows south toward Lake Washington through a green corridor that provides wildlife habitat and walking trails. The terrain rises gently from the lake's 300-foot elevation to higher ground in neighborhoods like Melody Hill, creating the \"terrace\" effect that inspired the city's name.\n\nThe city's climate mirrors the broader Puget Sound region but with microclimatic variations worth noting. Lake Ballinger's presence increases humidity in surrounding neighborhoods, particularly during summer evenings when cooler air settles over the water. Annual rainfall averages about 37 inches, concentrated between October and May. Summers bring reliably pleasant weather with temperatures reaching the mid-70s. Winters are mild by national standards, with temperatures rarely dropping below freezing for extended periods.\n\nThe original neighborhoods—Gateway, Cedar Terrace, Cedar Way—feature mid-century ramblers and split-levels on generous lots with mature landscaping. These homes attract families seeking affordable entry into homeownership in a strong school district. The Town Center area has seen significant redevelopment since light rail planning began, with new apartment buildings and condominiums bringing younger residents and urban energy. The Recreation Pavilion and Nile Golf Course provide community gathering spaces uncommon in cities this size.\n\nLight rail transformed Mountlake Terrace's trajectory. The 2024 opening of the Lynnwood Link Extension placed a station directly in the city's Town Center, connecting residents to downtown Seattle in under 30 minutes. Property values near the station have increased substantially, and development pressure has intensified. Long-time residents watch this transformation with mixed emotions—appreciating improved transit access while mourning the loss of affordable neighborhood character that defined the community.\n\nThe population reflects the city's accessibility and diversity. Mountlake Terrace has become notably more diverse over the past two decades, with significant Asian, Hispanic, and immigrant communities finding affordable housing near employment centers. The school district serves this diversity well, and community events like the Tour de Terrace summer festival bring neighbors together across demographic lines. This isn't a wealthy enclave or a struggling suburb—it's a working middle-class community where families invest in their homes and take pride in their neighborhoods.`;\nconst MountlakeTerraceArticle = () => (\n  <article className=\"space-y-12\">\n    {/* Company Introduction */}\n    <section className=\"space-y-6\">\n      <h2 className=\"text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold\">\n        Mountlake Terrace Fence Company - MyFence.com\n      </h2>\n      <div className=\"grid md:grid-cols-4 gap-6\">\n        <Card className=\"p-6 text-center\">\n          <div className=\"text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-2\">30+</div>\n          <div className=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">Years Experience</div>\n        </Card>\n        <Card className=\"p-6 text-center\">\n          <div className=\"text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-2\">98%+</div>\n          <div className=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">On-Time Installation Rate</div>\n        </Card>\n        <Card className=\"p-6 text-center\">\n          <div className=\"text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-2\">5.0</div>\n          <div className=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">Average Star Rating</div>\n        </Card>\n        <Card className=\"p-6 text-center\">\n          <div className=\"text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-2\">150+</div>\n          <div className=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">Five-Star Reviews</div>\n        </Card>\n      </div>\n      <p className=\"text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed text-lg\">\n        Looking for affordable quality fence installation in Mountlake Terrace?

We source Western Red Cedar with tight grain patterns and concentrated natural oils — the kind that handles constant dampness without checking or warping. Homeowners in Cedar Way and Gateway neighborhoods often replace fences that failed prematurely because contractors used lumber graded for drier climates. We've learned which mills produce cedar that actually performs here.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed\">\n          Post rot claims most fences in Mountlake Terrace before the boards ever fail. Our standard installation sets pressure-treated posts in concrete with the top sloped away from the wood — a small detail that prevents water pooling. For properties along Ballinger Creek or backing onto park areas, we recommend our <Link href=\"/fence-upgrades/post-on-pipe\" className=\"text-primary underline decoration-2 underline-offset-2\">Post-on-Pipe system</Link> that keeps cedar completely out of the ground. The extra cost pays off when you're not replacing posts every 12-15 years.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n\n      {/* Materials We Install */}\n      <div className=\"space-y-3\">\n        <h3 className=\"text-2xl font-semibold\">Focused on What Works — Not Everything</h3>\n        <p className=\"text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed\">\n          Some contractors list fifteen fence types on their website and install whichever sells. We took the opposite approach — three systems we know inside out. Every crew member has built hundreds of cedar, hogwire, and hybrid aluminum fences. When something unexpected happens on-site (and something always does), they've seen it before.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed\">\n          <strong>Western Red Cedar</strong> handles Mountlake Terrace's wet winters and delivers that classic Northwest look — we install it in picture frame, horizontal, craftsman, and solid board styles. <strong>Hogwire</strong> works well for corner lots and properties backing onto Interurban Trail where homeowners want boundaries without blocking sightlines. <strong>Hybrid Aluminum/Cedar</strong> appeals to younger families moving into Town Center's newer developments who'd rather spend weekends at the lake than staining a fence.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n\n      {/* Other Materials - Information Only */}\n      <div className=\"space-y-3 border-l-4 border-muted pl-4\">\n        <h3 className=\"text-2xl font-semibold text-muted-foreground\">Materials We Don't Install (And Why)</h3>\n        <p className=\"text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed text-sm\">\n          <em>Sharing this so you can make informed comparisons — we're not trying to sell you on materials we don't carry.</em>\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed\">\n          Vinyl fencing becomes brittle after years of UV exposure and cracks during cold snaps — we've seen failures throughout older Mountlake Terrace subdivisions. Composite boards expand and contract with temperature swings, creating gaps and warping over time. Chain-link and ornamental iron rust despite galvanizing claims, especially near Lake Ballinger's constant humidity. We'd rather specialize in materials we can confidently warranty than offer options we know underperform locally.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n\n      {/* Hybrid Aluminum System */}\n      <div className=\"space-y-3\">\n        <h3 className=\"text-2xl font-semibold\">Set-and-Forget Fencing for Busy Households</h3>\n        <p className=\"text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed\">\n          Between commuting to Seattle, managing kids' schedules, and actually enjoying the lake on weekends, most Mountlake Terrace families have zero interest in annual fence maintenance. Our hybrid system solves that problem — powder-coated aluminum panels that look identical in year ten as they did on installation day. No staining, no sealing, no pressure washing.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed\">\n          The cedar post-and-rail frame adds warmth that all-metal fences lack, blending with the established trees throughout Gateway and Melody Hill. Pressure-treated posts handle ground contact so the cedar frame stays dry and stable. We're seeing strong interest from first-time homebuyers in the newer condos near Town Center — people who want curb appeal without adding another chore to the list.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n\n    {/* Financing Section */}\n    <section className=\"space-y-4\">\n      <h2 className=\"text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold\">\n        Spread the Cost Without Waiting\n      </h2>\n      <div className=\"grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 items-start\">\n        <div className=\"space-y-4\">\n          <p className=\"text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed\">\n            A quality fence shouldn't require draining your savings or delaying until next year.

Fences under 8 feet in height typically do not require building permits, but must comply with zoning requirements including height limits and setback rules. Front yard fences are generally limited to 4 feet, while side and rear yard fences can be constructed up to 6 feet without special approval.\n      </p>\n      <p className=\"text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed\">\n        Property line verification is essential before installation to prevent disputes with neighbors and ensure compliance with setback requirements.

Front yard fences are limited to 4 feet; side and rear can go up to 6 feet. Properties near critical areas or with HOA oversight may need additional approvals.
