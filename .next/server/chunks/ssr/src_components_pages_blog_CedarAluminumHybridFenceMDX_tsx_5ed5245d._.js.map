With shorter panels from other suppliers, grade-following can significantly reduce your effective fence height.\"\n    },\n    {\n      question: \"What is the Ultimate Fence Package?\",\n      answer: \"The Ultimate Fence Package combines 4x4x12-foot Black Steel Posts, a 6-foot cedar-framed corrugated steel panel fence, and a 2-foot cedar horizontal lattice topper.
