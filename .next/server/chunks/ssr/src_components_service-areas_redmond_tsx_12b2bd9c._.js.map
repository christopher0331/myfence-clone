Located 15 miles east of Seattle on the Eastside of Lake Washington, Redmond occupies 17.2 square miles of rolling terrain where the Sammamish River flows northward toward Lake Washington.\n\nThe area's first settlers arrived in the 1870s, drawn by rich timber resources and fertile farmland. Luke McRedmond, the city's namesake, established a trading post in 1871 that would grow into the downtown core. The arrival of the railroad in 1888 accelerated growth, but Redmond remained primarily agricultural through the mid-20th century, known especially for its bicycle racing traditions that continue today at Marymoor Park's velodrome.\n\nThe transformation began in 1979 when Microsoft relocated from Albuquerque to Redmond, eventually establishing its sprawling corporate campus that now houses over 50,000 employees. Nintendo of America followed in 1982, cementing Redmond's identity as a global technology hub. Today, the city hosts numerous tech companies, startups, and research facilities, earning it the nickname \"Bicycle Capital of the Northwest\" for its extensive trail system and cycling culture that coexists with its tech identity.\n\nRedmond's geography shapes daily life profoundly. The city sits in a valley surrounded by forested hills, with Marymoor Park's 640 acres providing a green centerpiece along the Sammamish River. Bridle Trails State Park on the western edge preserves old-growth forest and maintains the city's equestrian heritage. The Sammamish River Trail connects Redmond to surrounding communities, while numerous neighborhood parks and green spaces give the city a distinctly less urban feel than Seattle.\n\nThe climate mirrors the greater Puget Sound region but with notable Eastside variations. Redmond receives approximately 35 inches of annual rainfall, roughly 10 inches less than Seattle, thanks to the rain shadow effect of the Olympic Mountains. Summers are pleasantly warm and dry, with temperatures averaging 75-80°F from June through September. Winters bring temperatures hovering around 40°F with occasional snow that can paralyze the hilly neighborhoods. The area experiences roughly 150 days of measurable precipitation annually, primarily between October and May.\n\nRedmond's neighborhoods reflect its evolution from rural community to tech hub. Education Hill, named for the schools that anchor it, attracts families seeking top-rated public education. Overlake has transformed into a dense urban village near the Microsoft campus and new light rail stations. Grass Lawn and Willows/Rose Hill maintain more traditional suburban character, while Idylwood and areas near Bridle Trails offer larger lots and forest proximity. This diversity means fence installations must account for everything from tight urban lots to expansive properties bordering protected forestland.\n\nThe economic vitality brings both opportunity and challenge. Median household income exceeds $130,000, driving demand for premium home improvements including fencing. Property values in desirable neighborhoods often exceed $1 million, justifying investments in quality materials and craftsmanship. The highly educated population tends to research thoroughly before purchasing, expecting clear communication and technical competence from contractors.`;\n\nconst RedmondArticle = () => (\n  <article className=\"space-y-12\">\n    {/* Company Introduction */}\n    <section className=\"space-y-6\">\n      <h2 className=\"text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold\">\n        Redmond Fence Company - MyFence.com\n      </h2>\n      <div className=\"grid md:grid-cols-4 gap-6\">\n        <Card className=\"p-6 text-center\">\n          <div className=\"text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-2\">30+</div>\n          <div className=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">Years Experience</div>\n        </Card>\n        <Card className=\"p-6 text-center\">\n          <div className=\"text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-2\">98%+</div>\n          <div className=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">On-Time Installation Rate</div>\n        </Card>\n        <Card className=\"p-6 text-center\">\n          <div className=\"text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-2\">5.0</div>\n          <div className=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">Average Star Rating</div>\n        </Card>\n        <Card className=\"p-6 text-center\">\n          <div className=\"text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-2\">150+</div>\n          <div className=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">Five-Star Reviews</div>\n        </Card>\n      </div>\n      <p className=\"text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed text-lg\">\n        Looking for modern fence installation in Redmond?

The city's professionals expect modern aesthetics, quality craftsmanship, and low-maintenance solutions that align with their busy lifestyles. Neighborhoods like Overlake, Education Hill, and Grass Lawn feature newer developments with homeowners associations that mandate specific fence styles, colors, and materials - requiring installers who understand both design requirements and architectural review processes.\n      </p>\n      <p className=\"text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed\">\n        The city's extensive park system and proximity to natural areas like Marymoor Park and Bridle Trails State Park mean many properties border greenbelt and forest land. This creates challenges with wildlife, particularly deer that can damage gardens and landscaping. Properties near the Sammamish River corridor face additional moisture considerations, while the rolling terrain throughout much of Redmond requires fence designs that accommodate elevation changes while maintaining a level, professional appearance. The combination of high property values, environmental awareness, and design-conscious residents means fence installations must balance functionality with aesthetic appeal.\n      </p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section className=\"space-y-4\">\n      <h3 className=\"text-2xl font-semibold\">Redmond Building Codes and Permit Requirements</h3>\n      <p className=\"text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed\">\n        The City of Redmond follows specific requirements outlined in the <a href=\"https://www.redmond.gov/823/Building-Division\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className=\"text-primary underline decoration-2 underline-offset-2\">Redmond Development Services</a> regulations. Residential fences under 8 feet in height typically do not require a building permit, but must comply with zoning requirements including height limits and setback rules. Front yard fences are generally limited to 4 feet, while side and rear yard fences can be constructed up to 6 feet without special approval.\n      </p>\n      <p className=\"text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed\">\n        Many Redmond neighborhoods, particularly newer developments built since the 1990s, have homeowners associations with detailed architectural guidelines. Communities near Microsoft campus and in the Overlake area often require pre-approval of fence designs, with specifications covering everything from board spacing to stain colors. Some HOAs restrict certain fence styles entirely or require specific cedar grades to maintain neighborhood aesthetics. We recommend reviewing your CC&Rs and submitting designs to your architectural committee early in the planning process.\n      </p>\n      <p className=\"text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed\">\n        Properties backing to critical areas such as streams, wetlands, or steep slopes may require additional review under Redmond's environmental codes. The city takes protection of the Bear Creek and other waterways seriously, with buffer requirements that may affect fence placement. Always verify exact property boundaries with a current survey before installation - this prevents disputes with neighbors and ensures compliance with setback requirements.

Residential fences under 8 feet typically do not require building permits but must comply with zoning requirements including height limits and setback rules. Front yard fences are generally limited to 4 feet, while side and rear yard fences can be constructed up to 6 feet without special approval.\n      </p>\n      <p className=\"text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed\">\n        Many Redmond neighborhoods, particularly developments built since the 1990s near Microsoft campus and Overlake, have homeowners associations with detailed architectural guidelines. These often require pre-approval of fence designs with specifications covering board spacing, stain colors, and style restrictions. We recommend reviewing your CC&Rs and submitting designs to your architectural committee early in planning.\n      </p>\n      <p className=\"text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed\">\n        Properties backing to critical areas such as streams, wetlands, or steep slopes may require additional review under Redmond's environmental codes. The city protects Bear Creek and other waterways with buffer requirements affecting fence placement. Always verify exact property boundaries with current surveys before installation.

Our superior 4.125\" x 4.125\" posts provide nearly 5 square inches more cross-sectional area than box store posts, resisting the warping and rot that shorten fence lifespan. We install posts with concrete at surface level to prevent soil contact and rot, and source our cedar from Pacific Northwest mills for optimal moisture content and quality. Regular cleaning and re-staining every 3-5 years can extend your fence life beyond 35 years, making it a decades-long investment in your property.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <h4 className=\"font-semibold mb-2\">What fence height deters deer in Redmond?</h4>\n          <p className=\"text-muted-foreground\">\n            For effective deer deterrence in Redmond's greenbelt-adjacent properties, we recommend 8-foot fence heights. Deer can jump 6-foot fences when motivated by garden plants or landscaping. Our 8-foot privacy fence installations use reinforced 4.125\" x 4.125\" posts for the additional strength required, ensuring your fence remains stable and straight for decades while protecting your landscaping investment from wildlife damage.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <h4 className=\"font-semibold mb-2\">How do I get HOA approval for my fence in Redmond?</h4>\n          <p className=\"text-muted-foreground\">\n            We help streamline HOA approval by providing professional renderings and specifications that meet architectural committee requirements.

However, we work year-round and can accommodate winter installations when needed. Redmond's slightly drier climate compared to Seattle means we have more workable days during shoulder seasons. Early summer installation allows time for concrete to fully cure before winter rains, maximizing the longevity of your fence foundation.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </Card>\n    </section>\n\n    <section className=\"bg-muted/50 p-6 rounded-lg border\">\n      <p className=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">\n        <strong>Note:</strong> Regulations and HOA requirements are subject to change.
