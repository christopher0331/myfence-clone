Situated directly across Lake Washington from Seattle, Bellevue occupies 36 square miles of rolling terrain where downtown skyscrapers rise above forested neighborhoods and waterfront estates.\n\nThe area's recorded history begins with Native American settlements along the lake shores, followed by European American pioneers who arrived in the 1860s seeking farmland. The name \"Bellevue,\" French for \"beautiful view,\" was coined in 1882 by Postmaster Bert Marett's wife, inspired by the panoramic vistas of Lake Washington and the Cascade Mountains. The community remained agricultural through the mid-20th century, known particularly for its Japanese-American strawberry farms that were tragically disrupted by World War II internment.\n\nThe transformation from bedroom community to economic powerhouse began with the construction of the first Lake Washington floating bridge in 1940, followed by the opening of Bellevue Square shopping center in 1946. By the 1990s, technology companies discovered Bellevue's advantages: proximity to Seattle without its urban congestion, excellent schools, and a business-friendly environment. Today, Bellevue hosts headquarters and major offices for Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, T-Mobile, and countless startups, earning its reputation as Seattle's corporate sibling.\n\nThe city's geography creates distinct neighborhoods with varying character. Downtown Bellevue has transformed into an urban village with high-rises, luxury retail, and world-class dining. Medina and Clyde Hill represent old-money estates where tech billionaires now neighbor legacy families. West Bellevue neighborhoods like Enatai and Beaux Arts enjoy waterfront access and historic character. The Crossroads area provides diverse, affordable options, while Somerset and Newport Hills offer hillside living with Cascade Mountain views.\n\nBellevue's climate reflects its position in the Puget Sound Lowland but with notable differences from Seattle. The city receives approximately 37 inches of annual rainfall, similar to Seattle but distributed differently across the year. The \"dual-lake effect\" from Lake Washington and Lake Sammamish creates a distinct microclimate with 15-20% more humidity than areas further from water. Summers are gloriously dry and warm, with temperatures averaging 75-80°F from July through September. Winters remain mild by national standards, hovering around 40°F with occasional snow that rarely lingers in lower elevations.\n\nThe city's prosperity brings unique considerations for property improvements. Median home values exceed $1.5 million in many neighborhoods, with waterfront properties and prestigious areas like Medina commanding prices in the tens of millions. This real estate landscape means homeowners invest significantly in quality improvements that enhance rather than diminish property values. Homeowners associations in newer developments and architectural review boards in established neighborhoods enforce strict standards for exterior modifications.\n\nBellevue's diverse population includes families attracted by the Bellevue School District's nationally-ranked schools, executives drawn by corporate headquarters, international residents (approximately 40% of residents speak a language other than English at home), and retirees enjoying the city's amenities. This demographic mix creates demand for varying fence styles: modern horizontal designs in contemporary developments, traditional cedar privacy fences in family neighborhoods, and estate-style fencing with automated gates in luxury enclaves.`;\n\nconst BellevueArticle = () => (\n  <article className=\"space-y-12\">\n    {/* Company Introduction */}\n    <section className=\"space-y-6\">\n      <h2 className=\"text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold\">\n        Bellevue Fence Company - MyFence.com\n      </h2>\n      <div className=\"grid md:grid-cols-4 gap-6\">\n        <Card className=\"p-6 text-center\">\n          <div className=\"text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-2\">30+</div>\n          <div className=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">Years Experience</div>\n        </Card>\n        <Card className=\"p-6 text-center\">\n          <div className=\"text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-2\">98%+</div>\n          <div className=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">On-Time Installation Rate</div>\n        </Card>\n        <Card className=\"p-6 text-center\">\n          <div className=\"text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-2\">5.0</div>\n          <div className=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">Average Star Rating</div>\n        </Card>\n        <Card className=\"p-6 text-center\">\n          <div className=\"text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-2\">150+</div>\n          <div className=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">Five-Star Reviews</div>\n        </Card>\n      </div>\n      <p className=\"text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed text-lg\">\n        Looking for a trusted Bellevue fencing company?

Instead of traditional all-wood construction, we use black aluminum panels with a cedar frame and pressure-treated fence posts. This innovative system delivers a modern, sleek appearance while dramatically reducing maintenance requirements compared to traditional wood fencing.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed\">\n          The aluminum panels never require staining, painting, or sealing - perfect for busy Bellevue professionals in neighborhoods like Factoria and Eastgate. The cedar framework provides natural warmth and structural support while the pressure-treated posts ensure long-term stability in Bellevue's humid microclimate. This hybrid approach keeps pricing competitive with traditional wood fencing while offering superior longevity and minimal upkeep.

From stringent HOA requirements in luxury communities to Washington's wet climate and Bellevue's specific municipal codes, every element demands careful consideration. The city's position between two major lakes creates microclimates that affect material longevity, while its mix of historic neighborhoods and modern developments means fence regulations can vary significantly by location. Additionally, Bellevue's steep terrain in areas like Somerset and Factoria requires specialized engineering considerations that flat-land fence installations don't face.\n      </p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section className=\"space-y-4\">\n      <h3 className=\"text-2xl font-semibold\">Permits and Property Line Requirements</h3>\n      <p className=\"text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed\">\n        Before breaking ground on your fence project, understanding Bellevue's permit requirements is essential. According to the <a href=\"https://bellevuewa.gov/city-government/departments/development/zoning-and-land-use/zoning-requirements/fences\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className=\"text-primary underline decoration-2 underline-offset-2\">City of Bellevue Development Services</a>, you do not need a building permit unless your fence exceeds 8 feet in height, will be located within a critical area or critical area buffer, or is constructed of concrete blocks or similar materials. However, all fences must comply with <a href=\"https://bellevue.municipal.codes/#!/LUC/BellevueLUC2020.html%2320.20.400\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className=\"text-primary underline decoration-2 underline-offset-2\">Land Use Code 20.20.400</a> regarding height limits, setback requirements, and sight-obstruction restrictions at intersections per <a href=\"https://bellevue.municipal.codes/BCC/14.60.240\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className=\"text-primary underline decoration-2 underline-offset-2\">BCC 14.60.240</a> and <a href=\"https://bellevue.municipal.codes/BCC/14.60.241\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className=\"text-primary underline decoration-2 underline-offset-2\">BCC 14.60.241</a>.\n      </p>\n      <p className=\"text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed\">\n        For residential properties, fences in required front-yard setbacks are limited to 4 feet, 6 inches in height, with exceptions for arterial streets, corner lots, or screening purposes when specific criteria are met. Fences outside the front-yard setback may exceed this height. If your property contains critical areas such as wetlands, streams, or steep slopes, or is within the Shoreline Overlay District, additional limitations apply under <a href=\"https://bellevue.municipal.codes/LUC/20.25E\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className=\"text-primary underline decoration-2 underline-offset-2\">LUC 20.25E</a> and <a href=\"https://bellevue.municipal.codes/LUC/20.25H\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className=\"text-primary underline decoration-2 underline-offset-2\">LUC 20.25H</a>.
