While steel posts cost $225-$250 each compared to $45-$75 for wood, the long-term value is significant: wood posts typically last 10-15 years before rotting, meaning potential replacement costs of $300-$450+ over 40 years. Steel posts never rot, resist moisture damage, and provide a modern black aesthetic. Installation is similar for both, setting posts 24 inches deep with concrete.
