      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Cedar fence panels often outlast wood posts, but when posts fail the entire fence must be replaced. Steel posts outlast cedar panels, so when it's time to refresh your fence, the posts stay in place. Combined with Fence Genius technology that stores your exact fence specifications, you only pay for new pre-fabricated panels—saving approximately 40% compared to a full fence replacement."
